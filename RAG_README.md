# RAG-Enhanced Resume Reviewer Assistant ✅ FIXED

## Overview
This Chainlit application includes **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** functionality that chunks uploaded resume text and uses vector similarity search to provide more accurate, context-aware analysis.

## ✅ **RECENT FIX**
**Issue**: `'InMemoryDocstore' object has no attribute 'dict'` error when uploading files.
**Solution**: Updated the vectorstore chunk counting mechanism to avoid accessing deprecated attributes.
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - File uploads now work correctly with proper chunk counting.

## RAG Implementation Features

### 🔍 **Text Chunking**
- Uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from LangChain
- Chunk size: 500 characters with 50-character overlap
- Preserves context while breaking down large documents
- Creates metadata for each chunk (source, chunk_id, total_chunks)

### 🎯 **Vector Search**
- **Vector Store**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Embeddings**: HuggingFace sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2
- **Similarity Search**: Retrieves top 4-6 most relevant chunks per query
- **Context-Aware**: Analysis based only on relevant resume sections

### 🚀 **Enhanced Query Processing**
- **Smart Retrieval**: Different search queries for different analysis types
- **Targeted Analysis**: Skills analysis focuses on skills-related chunks
- **Comprehensive Reviews**: Full reviews use broader search terms
- **RAG-Enhanced Responses**: All responses include chunk count and relevance info

## How RAG Works in the App

### 1. **File Upload Process**
```python
# When a resume is uploaded:
1. Extract text from PDF/DOCX/TXT
2. Create text chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
4. Build FAISS vector store
5. Store vectorstore globally for queries
```

### 2. **Query Processing**
```python
# For user questions:
1. Take user query (e.g., "How are my skills?")
2. Search vector store for relevant chunks
3. Retrieve top 4 relevant sections
4. Send relevant context to LLM instead of full resume
5. Generate focused, accurate response
```

### 3. **Action Button Analysis**
```python
# For structured analysis:
1. Use predefined search queries per analysis type
2. "skills_analysis" -> search for skills-related chunks
3. "experience_review" -> search for experience chunks
4. "ats_check" -> search for keyword-related content
5. Generate targeted analysis based on relevant sections
```

## Key Benefits

### ✅ **Improved Accuracy**
- LLM receives only relevant resume sections
- Reduces hallucinations and irrelevant responses
- Focus on specific areas per user question

### ✅ **Better Performance**
- Smaller context window for LLM
- Faster processing with relevant chunks only
- More efficient token usage

### ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**
- More targeted and specific feedback
- Analysis based on actual resume content
- Clear indication of which sections were analyzed

## Technical Components

### **Dependencies Added**
```
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-community
faiss-cpu
sentence-transformers
```

### **Key Functions**
- `create_chunks_and_vectorstore()`: Creates chunks and builds vector store
- `handle_query_with_llm()`: RAG-enhanced query processing
- `handle_resume_analysis()`: RAG-enhanced structured analysis

### **Global Variables**
- `vectorstore`: FAISS vector store instance
- `embeddings_model`: HuggingFace embeddings model
- `extracted_text`: Original resume text (backup)

## Usage Instructions

### **To Run the App**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
chainlit run app.py
```

### **To Test RAG Functionality**
```bash
# Run the test script
python test_rag.py
```

## Example RAG Flow

1. **User uploads resume** → Text chunked into 6 sections
2. **User asks "What skills do I have?"** → Vector search finds 2 skills-related chunks
3. **LLM receives only relevant chunks** → Generates targeted skills analysis
4. **Response includes chunk count** → "Analysis based on 2 most relevant resume sections"

## Configuration

### **Chunk Settings** (can be adjusted)
```python
chunk_size=500        # Characters per chunk
chunk_overlap=50      # Overlap between chunks
k=4                   # Number of chunks to retrieve
```

### **Embedding Model** (can be changed)
```python
model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
```

The RAG implementation makes the resume analysis more precise, efficient, and user-focused by ensuring the AI only analyzes the most relevant parts of the resume for each specific question or analysis type.
